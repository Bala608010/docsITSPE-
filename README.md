### Optimizing ODE
To optimize OD_matrix we are using Particle Swarm Optimizer(PSO). 

For the implemtaion of the PSO we chose a PSO toolkit called Pyswarms 

### Prerequisite 
1. Sumo Version 1.5.0
2. Python3
3. Pyswarms 
    For installations and information about Pyswarms please refer - https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For optimzing the OD_matrix we requrie three files: 
1. PSO_code.py - PSO code
2. fun_req.py - Functions that are requried to run the PSO_code.py file
3. config.ini - Configuration file to configure variables in the code

The following attributes/elements are used within config.ini:
1. directory_config : Managing the Directorys
   - Input_directory : The directory which contains the model.
   - temp_directory : The directory to which the temporary files should be created. 
2. File_requried : Managing the file needed to run sumo
   - network_file : network file to to sumo model 
   - sumo_config_file : configuartion file for sumo
   - routes_file : Routes file for sumo model 
   - Undated_tlLoggic_file : The initial TlLogiic for the model from the network file. 
   - additional_taz_file : Traffic assignement zones file
   - additional_vehicle_type_file : Additional file containing the vehicle type. 
   - additional_e_file : Additional Detector file.
   - end_time : The time upto which sumo has to run.
3. PSO_configuration : Managing the PSO parameters. 
   - Iterations : Number of iterations for PSO. 
   - no_of_particles : Number of particles for PSO.
   - options : dict with keys {'c1', 'c2', 'w', 'p', 'k'} â€“ a dictionary containing the parameters for the specific optimization technique
     - c1 (float): cognitive parameter
     - c2 (float): social parameter
     - w (float): inertia parameter
     - p (int {1,2}) : the Minkowski p-norm to use. 1 is the sum-of-absolute values (or L1 distance) while 2 is the Euclidean (or L2) distance.
     - k (int): number of neighbors to be considered. Must be a positive integer less than n_particles. 
    - multiplier_number : The upper limit ot the value that each element in the each particle can take for initial guess. 
    - percentage : the percentage of particles near the input particle. 
4. Objective_function : Manage the parameters for Objective function. 
   - cost_function_type : we can choose how to calculate the cost function. 
     - diff : Just take the difference between actual flow and the simulated flow. 
     - MAPE : Mean Absolute Percentage Error of the actual flow and the simulated flow.
     - GEH : GEH Statistic of the actual flow and the simulated flow.
   - attribute_eoutput : The attribute to be considered for calculating the cost from the e_output files. 
   - type : There are two modes of running the file. 
     - online : We will be runing Dusrouter for the model
     - offline : We will be runing sumo for the model
### Run the code 
We have to make the requried changes to in config.ini file. 
Then we have to simply run the PSO_code.py file. we will get the output in the output file directory. 

### process for optimizing 
- We get the od_matrix from the OD_matrix file given in config.ini. This is consider to be input particle to the code.
- Based on the given percentage we will create those many particles close to the input particle and the remining particles ae choosen randomly. So these are the initial positions of the particles. 
- We have to choose the bounds. to make sure that particles won't excide a certain limit. 
- we genrate the object my_swarms object. 
- We have to design the function to be minimized. In this case we have to optimize difference between the real flow and the simulated flow. 
  - Take each particle from the my_swarms.position and make the od_matrix file. 
  - Run the we can run SUMO or Duarouter using the genrated trips file and other files mensioned in the config.ini. 
  - we get the simulaed flow from the e1_output file for sumo or routes file for duaroter. 
- The above three processes are parallalized for better speed. 
- The real flow and simulated flow will be given to objective function this function will give the cost. 
- Based on the cost we can calculate the p_best and G_best and update the position and velocity. 
- This will run for given number of iterations. 
- my_swarm.best_cost will give the best cost. 
- my_swarm.best_pos will give the best position.
